# Cardiology-Dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing a Heart Disease dataset to uncover meaningful insights about factors influencing cardiovascular health. Using Excel for data preprocessing and Power BI for visualization, this project transforms raw data into interactive dashboards that help understand key health indicators and their impact on heart disease risk.

# Cardiology Dashboard Insights

- Overall survival rate: **67.89%**; deaths **(96)** exceed survivals **(59)**.
- Best survival **(75.9%)** seen in ages **61–70**; lowest **(43.4%)** in **71+**, showing strong age impact.
- Higher serum creatinine in older groups **(1.27 in 71+)** indicates renal issues reduce survival.
- Ejection fraction is lowest **(38.5%)** in ages **40–50**, suggesting weaker heart function.
- Smoking, hypertension, anaemia, and diabetes are most common in **51–70** age group.
- Overall, age, kidney function, and heart efficiency are key predictors of survival.
